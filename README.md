# Beginners' Python

## Workshop

* Programming Background (secret program flow)
* Installing Python
    * VSCode and Python Extension
* History of Python
* Rationale
* ***Activity 0 - Intro to the REPL***
* Hello World
    * Intro to the REPL
* Primitive Data-Types (int, float, string, bool)
* Operators
    * REPL as a calculator
* Variables
* Moving into file-based programs
* Input (Type Casting, F-Strings)
    * Introducer bot
    * len() for length of name, in f-string
    * Number entry and odd / even checker
* Conditions
    * FizzBuzz checker (non-looping)
* Simple Loops
    * for-range fizzbuzz loop
* ***Activity 1 - Interactive User System***
* Lists (indexing)
    * play around in the repl
    * select from input as a fake user id log in
* Advanced Collections (Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples)
    * username / password based entry to a system
* Loops (for, while, break, continue)
    * list all users on screen (then users made before / after)
    * build our own REPL!
* Functions (default args)
    * separate concerns (user inputselection vs action, move out into separate functions for each action)
    * Don't repeat yourself - user authentication repeated for different login moves
    * (aside, recursion and fibonnaci sequence)
* Modules
    * random number guesser
* External File Interaction
    * Writing calculations to a file
    * Reading inputs from a file
* ***Activity 2 - Turtle Spirograph***
    * Moving the turtle
    * Repeating to build a pattern
* Classes
    * Spiro Class (position, turn, angle, acceleration factor)
    * Spiro Pivot Class (represents centre of page, can have connected spiros)
* ***Activity 3 - Scripting & Scraping***
    * Installing Packages from PyPI via pip (svg-turtle)
    * Get blog names, and convert to hyphenated (a-z0-9-) (beautifulsoup4)
    * Convert to two numbers, representing spiro size, and one more representing acceleration (0.5 - 1.5
* Exceptions
    * urllib wrong URL
    * reading a missing file (config.txt - used to configure end point and css selector text search)
    * writing to a file that already exists (just the new name for now), accidentally overwritten, enable createnew
    * handle already existing file (overwrite save file function with y/n prompt)
    * write out svg files (svglib "reportlab<4")
* More Scripting
    * File conversion and renaming (append OS datetime)
* Advanced
    * Complex Numbers
    * Structured Pattern Matching
    * Lambda Expressions
    * global / nonlocal keywords
    * List Comprehension
    * Generators / Coroutines
    * For-Else Loops
    * Mutable default arguments
    * Classes
    * Iterables
